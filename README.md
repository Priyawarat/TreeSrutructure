# TreeSructure
Construct a chain tree in JAVA using simple Tree Data-Structure. Root person has two nodes then these two nodes has further two nodes and so on. Either we can add and delete any node which we want by simple giving the name of the node. 

Tree View:
*--->Root
     *--->Employee Id2
          *--->Employee Id4
          *--->Employee Id5
     *--->Employee Id3
          *--->Employee Id6
          *--->Employee Id7

Tree View after deleting node Employee Id5:
*--->Root
     *--->Employee Id2
          *--->Employee Id4
     *--->Employee Id3
          *--->Employee Id6
          *--->Employee Id7
